# mekuri

`Mekuri` is a React package for page transition animations with `wait` and `sync` modes, supporting `popstate` and `scroll restoration`.

Customize animations per component with the `useMekuri` hook and use with libraries like `GSAP`. It integrates with Next.js and Remix; can also be integrated with Next.js `App Router`, but for stable operation it is recommended to use Pages Router rather than App Router.

```bash
$ npm i @funtech-inc/mekuri
```
